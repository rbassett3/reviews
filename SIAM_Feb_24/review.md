# MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD PROBABILITY MEASURES OVER SETS AND APPLICATIONS TO DATA-DRIVEN OPTIMIZATION
## Referee Report

### Summary

This manuscript proposes a nonparametric estimator for estimating the distribution of a random variable when, instead of observing the random variable directly, the decision maker observes a set *containing* the random variable. The decision maker must use these sets to construct an estimate of the distribution of the underlying random variable, which they deem a maximum likelihood probability measure (mlpm). In the first part of section 3, the authors provide measure theoretic lemmas which show that this mplm belongs to the collection of maximal intersections, which allows the authors to formulate a convex program which solves for the mlpm (but with problem size that scales exponentially in the number of observations). Later sections provide convergence bounds and counterexamples under various notions of stochastic convergence and distributional assumptions. The manuscript concludes with an application of their proposed methodology to distributionally robust optimization.

### Recommendation

The problem formulated is interesting and important, but there are many issues with the problem statement and its formulation. The early parts of the manuscript, where the problem is introduced and early lemmas are proven, is entirely measure theoretic. But the measure theory presented is incorrect in major ways, which undermines the remainder of the paper. Perhaps some of this can be remedied so that later results still stand (and this seems especially likely for the computational results). For these reasons, this referee recommends rejection.

### Details

In this section I will detail the issues described in the previous section. First, I will review the setup.

1. On line 120, the authors assume that there is an underlying probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, and a measurable space $(\Psi, \mathcal{G})$.

2. On line 187: The underlying random "element" maps $c: \Omega \to \Psi$ (presumably a measurable function, though this isn't stated) with distribution $\mu^{0}: \mathcal{G} \to [0,1]$, which corresponds to $\mathbb{P}$.

3. On line 122: The observations are sets $C$ which take values in $\mathcal{G}$. The random variable $c \in C$.

Now here is the issue: The authors repeatedly conflate the notions of a random object (where the statistical analysis takes place) with a realization of that object (after which optimization takes place). The observed sets $C$ must be **random** for this problem to make sense (as they are in the motivating example in line 36.. But the measure theory used by the authors treats the $C$ sets as fixed, as they would be for setting up an optimization problem. This fact emerges as they set up the measurable space for observation of the random set $C$. 

On line 190, the authors write, "Recall that $\mathcal{C}^{t} = \{C^{s}: s \in [t]\}$ corresponds to the sets observed until $t$; we define the measurable space $(\Psi^{t}, \mathcal{G}^{t})$ as $\Psi^{t} := \bigcup_{s \in [t]} C^{s}$ and $\mathcal{G}^{t} := \sigma(\mathcal{C}^{t})$. Note that $\{(\Psi^{t}, \mathcal{G}^{t})\, t \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}\}$ is an increasing sequence of measurable space (i.e. $\Psi^{s} \subseteq \Psi^{t}$ and $\mathcal{G}^{s} \subseteq \mathcal{G}^{t}$ for any $s \leq t$) and that all of them are contained in the original one, i.e. $\Psi^{t} \subseteq \Psi$ and $\mathcal{G}^{t} \subseteq \mathcal{G}$ for any $t \in \mathcal{Z}_{+}$."

Line 190 is where the train starts to come off the tracks. Since the observed sets are random, what does it mean to construct a measure space using them? The sets $\Psi^{t} := \bigcup_{s \in [t]} C^{s}$ are themselves the union of random sets. So they're random. But how can a random set be used to define a (apparently random) measurable space? This defies any sensible interpretation of these objects. A similar issue occurs when constructing the sigma algebra $\mathcal{G}^{t}$. The authors take $\mathcal{G}^{t} := \sigma(\mathcal{C}^{t})$, which is presumably "the sigma algebra generated by the random sets $\mathcal{C}^{t}$". This is not a conventional notion, but "the sigma algebra generated by a random variable" is common, and one could imagine extending this to what the authors have in mind. For example, Oskendal's *Stochastic Differential Equations* contains the following definition: If $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is any function, then the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $X$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ containing all the sets $X^{-1}(U)$ where $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is open. (As a side comment, these increasing sequence of measure spaces should probably be referred to by its name--a filtration)

So the authors have not been very clear in their problem set up. But one can forgive them. Few people really love measure theory and one suspects that these are small, exceedingly abstract details may be sewn up later. Unfortunately this is not the case, because the authors use this flawed setup to immediately establish lemmas using this flawed setup. These lemmas form the cornerstone for the rest of the paper. In Lemma 3.2, the authors write that "... because $\mathcal{C}^{t}$ is a finite collection, we have that ... [$\mathcal{G}^{t}$ is finite]." Similarly, Lemma 3.3 concludes with "because $\mathcal{G}^{t}$ is finite". But the $\sigma$-algebra generated by a finite numbers of random variables need not be finite! So this certainly cannot be the case for random sets. On line 227 this mistake is especially apparent, because the authors **use the random sets $C^{s}$ to define the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}^{t}$**. So, similar to the set in the measurable space, the $\sigma$ algebra is also a random object. This again defies any sensible interpretation. Here the authors are again confusing random with fixed quantities. 

The authors go on to use Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3, which characterize the atoms of $(\Phi^{t}, \mathcal{G}^{t})$, to form the foundation of the rest of the paper. But these lemmas have serious issues stemming from the fact that the authors use random sets $C^{s}$ as if they were nonrandom to define $(\Phi^{t}, \mathcal{G}^{t})$ incorrectly. These important points need to be revisited and corrected for this manuscript to be considered for publication.
